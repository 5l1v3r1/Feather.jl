[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dmbates/Feather.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaStats/Feather.jl)

[Feather](http://github.com/wesm/feather) is a format for saving and retrieving data frames.  
The repository provides the sources for _libfeather_, a C++ library to read and write the feather format,
and feather packages for `R` and for `Python/pandas`.

A Julia package to read and write the feather format will be built in this repository.
